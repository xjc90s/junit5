<p>This document consists of four sections:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Platform</dt>
    <dd>The JUnit Platform serves as a foundation for launching testing frameworks on the JVM.
        It also defines the TestEngine API for developing a testing framework that runs on the
        platform. Furthermore, the platform provides a Console Launcher to launch the platform
        from the command line and the Suite Engine for running a custom test suite using one
        or more test engines on the platform
    </dd>
    <dt>Jupiter</dt>
    <dd>JUnit Jupiter is the combination of the programming model and extension model for
        writing JUnit tests and extensions. The Jupiter subproject provides a TestEngine
        for running Jupiter based tests on the platform.
    </dd>
    <dt>Vintage</dt>
    <dd>JUnit Vintage provides a TestEngine for running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 based tests on the
        platform.
    </dd>
    <dt>Other Modules</dt>
    <dd>This section lists all modules that are not part of a dedicated section.
