= Parallel Execution

By default, JUnit Jupiter tests are run sequentially in a single thread; however, running
tests in parallel -- for example, to speed up execution -- is available as an opt-in
feature. To enable parallel execution, set the `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled`
configuration parameter to `true` -- for example, in `junit-platform.properties` (see
xref:running-tests/configuration-parameters.adoc[] for other options).

Please note that enabling this property is only the first step required to execute tests
in parallel. If enabled, test classes and methods will still be executed sequentially by
default. Whether or not a node in the test tree is executed concurrently is controlled by
its execution mode. The following two modes are available.

`SAME_THREAD`::
  Force execution in the same thread used by the parent. For example, when used on a test
  method, the test method will be executed in the same thread as any `@BeforeAll` or
  `@AfterAll` methods of the containing test class.

`CONCURRENT`::
  Execute concurrently unless a resource lock forces execution in the same thread.

By default, nodes in the test tree use the `SAME_THREAD` execution mode. You can change
the default by setting the `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default` configuration
parameter. Alternatively, you can use the `{Execution}` annotation to change the
execution mode for the annotated element and its subelements (if any) which allows you to
activate parallel execution for individual test classes, one by one.

[source,properties]
.Configuration parameters to execute all tests in parallel
----
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled = true
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default = concurrent
----

The default execution mode is applied to all nodes of the test tree with a few notable
exceptions, namely test classes that use the `Lifecycle.PER_CLASS` mode or a
`{MethodOrderer}`. In the former case, test authors have to ensure that the test class is
thread-safe; in the latter, concurrent execution might conflict with the configured
execution order. Thus, in both cases, test methods in such test classes are only executed
concurrently if the `@Execution(CONCURRENT)` annotation is present on the test class or
method.

You can use the `@Execution` annotation to explicitly configure the execution mode for a
test class or method:

[source,java]
----
include::example$java/example/ExplicitExecutionModeDemo.java[tags=user_guide]
----

This allows test classes or methods to opt in or out of concurrent execution regardless of
the globally configured default.

When parallel execution is enabled and a default `{ClassOrderer}` is registered (see
xref:writing-tests/test-execution-order.adoc#classes[Class Order] for details), top-level test classes will
initially be sorted accordingly and scheduled in that order. However, they are not
guaranteed to be started in exactly that order since the threads they are executed on are
not controlled directly by JUnit.

All nodes of the test tree that are configured with the `CONCURRENT` execution mode will
be executed fully in parallel according to the provided
<<config, configuration>> while observing the
declarative <<synchronization, synchronization>>
mechanism. Please note that xref:running-tests/capturing-standard-output-error.adoc[] needs to be enabled
separately.

In addition, you can configure the default execution mode for top-level classes by setting
the `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.classes.default` configuration parameter. By
combining both configuration parameters, you can configure classes to run in parallel but
their methods in the same thread:

[source,properties]
.Configuration parameters to execute top-level classes in parallel but methods in same thread
----
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled = true
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default = same_thread
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.classes.default = concurrent
----

The opposite combination will run all methods within one class in parallel, but top-level
classes will run sequentially:

[source,properties]
.Configuration parameters to execute top-level classes sequentially but their methods in parallel
----
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled = true
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default = concurrent
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.classes.default = same_thread
----

The following diagram illustrates how the execution of two top-level test classes `A` and
`B` with two test methods per class behaves for all four combinations of
`junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default` and
`junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.classes.default` (see labels in first column).

If the `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.classes.default` configuration parameter is
not explicitly set, the value for `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default` will be
used instead.

[[config]]
== Configuration

[[config-executor-service]]
=== Executor Service

If parallel execution is enabled, a thread pool is used behind the scenes to execute tests
concurrently. You can configure which implementation of `HierarchicalTestExecutorService`
is used be setting the `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.executor-service`
configuration parameter to one of the following options:

`fork_join_pool` (default)::
Use an executor service that is backed by a `ForkJoinPool` from the JDK. This will cause
tests to be executed in a `ForkJoinWorkerThread`. In some cases, usages of
`ForkJoinPool` in test or production code or calls to blocking JDK APIs may cause the
number of concurrently executing tests to increase. To avoid this situation, please use
`worker_thread_pool`.

`worker_thread_pool` (experimental)::
Use an executor service that is backed by a regular thread pool and does not create
additional threads if test or production code uses `ForkJoinPool` or calls a blocking
API in the JDK.

WARNING: Using `worker_thread_pool` is currently an _experimental_ feature. You're invited
to give it a try and provide feedback to the JUnit team so they can improve and eventually
xref:api-evolution.adoc[promote] this feature.

[[config-strategies]]
=== Strategies

Properties such as the desired parallelism and the maximum pool size can be configured
using a `{ParallelExecutionConfigurationStrategy}`. The JUnit Platform provides two
implementations out of the box: `dynamic` and `fixed`. Alternatively, you may implement a
`custom` strategy.

To select a strategy, set the `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.strategy`
configuration parameter to one of the following options.

`dynamic`::
  Computes the desired parallelism based on the number of available processors/cores
  multiplied by the `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.dynamic.factor`
  configuration parameter (defaults to `1`).
  The optional `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.dynamic.max-pool-size-factor`
  configuration parameter can be used to limit the maximum number of threads.

`fixed`::
  Uses the mandatory `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.parallelism`
  configuration parameter as the desired parallelism.
  The optional `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.max-pool-size`
  configuration parameter can be used to limit the maximum number of threads.

`custom`::
  Allows you to specify a custom `{ParallelExecutionConfigurationStrategy}`
  implementation via the mandatory `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.custom.class`
  configuration parameter to determine the desired configuration.

If no configuration strategy is set, JUnit Jupiter uses the `dynamic` configuration
strategy with a factor of `1`. Consequently, the desired parallelism will be equal to the
number of available processors/cores.

.Parallelism alone does not imply maximum number of concurrent threads
NOTE: By default, JUnit Jupiter does not guarantee that the number of threads used to
execute test will not exceed the configured parallelism. For example, when using one
of the synchronization mechanisms described in the next section, the executor service
implementation may spawn additional threads to ensure execution continues with sufficient
parallelism. If you require such guarantees, it is possible to limit the maximum number of
threads by configuring the maximum pool size of the `dynamic`, `fixed` and `custom`
strategies.

  for the ```custom``` configuration strategy (no default value).

[[synchronization]]
== Synchronization

In addition to controlling the execution mode using the `{Execution}` annotation, JUnit
Jupiter provides another annotation-based declarative synchronization mechanism. The
`{ResourceLock}` annotation allows you to declare that a test class or method uses a
specific shared resource that requires synchronized access to ensure reliable test
execution. The shared resource is identified by a unique name which is a `String`. The
name can be user-defined or one of the predefined constants in `{Resources}`:
`SYSTEM_PROPERTIES`, `SYSTEM_OUT`, `SYSTEM_ERR`, `LOCALE`, or `TIME_ZONE`.

In addition to declaring these shared resources statically, the `{ResourceLock}`
annotation has a `providers` attribute that allows registering implementations of the
`{ResourceLocksProvider}` interface that can add shared resources dynamically at runtime.
Note that resources declared statically with `{ResourceLock}` annotation are combined with
resources added dynamically by `{ResourceLocksProvider}` implementations.

If the tests in the following example were run in parallel _without_ the use of
`{ResourceLock}`, they would be _flaky_. Sometimes they would pass, and at other times they
would fail due to the inherent race condition of writing and then reading the same JVM
System Property.

When access to shared resources is declared using the `{ResourceLock}` annotation, the
JUnit Jupiter engine uses this information to ensure that no conflicting tests are run in
parallel. This guarantee extends to lifecycle methods of a test class or method. For
example, if a test method is annotated with a `{ResourceLock}` annotation, the "lock" will
be acquired before any `@BeforeEach` methods are executed and released after all
`@AfterEach` methods have been executed.

[NOTE]
.Running tests in isolation
====
If most of your test classes can be run in parallel without any synchronization but you
have some test classes that need to run in isolation, you can mark the latter with the
`{Isolated}` annotation. Tests in such classes are executed sequentially without any other
tests running at the same time.
====

In addition to the `String` that uniquely identifies the shared resource, you may specify
an access mode. Two tests that require `READ` access to a shared resource may run in
parallel with each other but not while any other test that requires `READ_WRITE` access
to the same shared resource is running.

[source,java]
.Adding shared resources "dynamically" with `{ResourceLocksProvider}` implementation
----
include::example$java/example/sharedresources/DynamicSharedResourcesDemo.java[tags=user_guide]
----

Also, "static" shared resources can be declared for _direct_ child nodes via the `target`
attribute in the `{ResourceLock}` annotation, the attribute accepts a value from
the `{ResourceLockTarget}` enum.

Specifying `target = CHILDREN` in a class-level `{ResourceLock}` annotation
has the same semantics as adding an annotation with the same `value` and `mode`
to each test method and nested test class declared in this class.

This may improve parallelization when a test class declares a `READ` lock,
but only a few methods hold a `READ_WRITE` lock.

Tests in the following example would run in the `SAME_THREAD` if the `{ResourceLock}`
didn't have `target = CHILDREN`. This is because the test class declares a `READ`
shared resource, but one test method holds a `READ_WRITE` lock,
which would force the `SAME_THREAD` execution mode for all the test methods.
