= Tagging and Filtering

Test classes and methods can be tagged via the `@Tag` annotation. Those tags can later be
used to filter xref:running-tests/intro.adoc[test discovery and execution]. Please refer to the
xref:running-tests/tags.adoc[] section for more information about tag support in the JUnit
Platform.
