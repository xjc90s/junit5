= Tagging and Filtering

Test classes and methods can be tagged via the `@Tag` annotation. Those tags can later be
used to filter <<running-tests, test discovery and execution>>. Please refer to the
<<running-tests-tags>> section for more information about tag support in the JUnit
Platform.

custom annotations for tags.
