= Assumptions

Assumptions are typically used whenever it does not make sense to continue execution of a
given test — for example, if the test depends on something that does not exist in the
current runtime environment.

* When an assumption is valid, the assumption method does not throw an exception, and
  execution of the test continues as usual.
* When an assumption is invalid, the assumption method throws an exception of type
  `org.opentest4j.TestAbortedException` to signal that the test should be aborted instead
  of marked as a failure.

JUnit Jupiter comes with a subset of the _assumption_ methods that JUnit 4 provides and
adds a few that lend themselves well to being used with Java lambda expressions and method
references.

All JUnit Jupiter assumptions are static methods in the `{Assumptions}` class.

NOTE: It is also possible to use methods from JUnit 4's `org.junit.Assume` class for
assumptions. Specifically, JUnit Jupiter supports JUnit 4's `AssumptionViolatedException`
to signal that a test should be aborted instead of marked as a failure.

TIP: If you use AssertJ for assertions, you may also wish to use AssertJ for assumptions.
To do so, you can statically import the `assumeThat()` method from
`org.assertj.core.api.Assumptions` and then use AssertJ's fluent API to specify your
assumptions.
