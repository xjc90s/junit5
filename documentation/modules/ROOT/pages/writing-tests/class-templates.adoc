= Class Templates

A `{ClassTemplate}` is not a regular test class but rather a template for the contained
test cases. As such, it is designed to be invoked multiple times depending on invocation
contexts returned by the registered providers. Thus, it must be used in conjunction with a
registered `{ClassTemplateInvocationContextProvider}` extension.
Each invocation of a class template behaves like the execution of a regular test class
with full support for the same lifecycle callbacks and extensions. Please refer to
xref:extensions/providing-invocation-contexts-for-class-templates.adoc[] for usage examples.

NOTE: xref:writing-tests/parameterized-classes-and-tests.adoc[Parameterized Classes] are a built-in
specialization of class templates.
