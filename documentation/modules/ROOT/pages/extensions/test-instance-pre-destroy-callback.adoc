= Test Instance Pre-destroy Callback

`{TestInstancePreDestroyCallback}` defines the API for `Extensions` that wish to process
test instances _after_ they have been used in tests and _before_ they are destroyed.

Common use cases include cleaning dependencies that have been injected into the
test instance, invoking custom de-initialization methods on the test instance, etc.
