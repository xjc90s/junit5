= Test Instance Pre-construct Callback

`{TestInstancePreConstructCallback}` defines the API for `Extensions` that wish to be invoked
_prior_ to test instances being constructed (by a constructor call or via
`{TestInstanceFactory}`).

This extension provides a symmetric call to `{TestInstancePreDestroyCallback}` and is useful
in combination with other extensions to prepare constructor parameters or keeping track of test
instances and their lifecycle.

[NOTE]
.Accessing the test-scoped `ExtensionContext`
====
You may override the `getTestInstantiationExtensionContextScope(...)` method to return
`TEST_METHOD` to make test-specific data available to your extension implementation or if
you want to <<extensions-keeping-state, keep state>> on the test method level.
