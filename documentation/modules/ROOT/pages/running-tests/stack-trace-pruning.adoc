=== Stack Trace Pruning

The JUnit Platform provides built-in support for pruning stack traces produced by failing
tests. This feature is enabled by default but can be disabled by setting the
`junit.platform.stacktrace.pruning.enabled` _configuration parameter_ to `false`.

When enabled, all calls from the `org.junit`, `jdk.internal.reflect`, and `sun.reflect`
packages are removed from the stack trace, unless the calls occur after the test itself
or any of its ancestors. For that reason, calls to `{Assertions}` or `{Assumptions}` will
never be excluded.

In addition, all elements prior to and including the first call from the JUnit Platform
`Launcher` will be removed.
